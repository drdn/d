First post. 

## Here is some bold text, dudes. 

As is tradition, this innaugural blog post is nonsense. I'm still experimenting with creating websites using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). While this blog design uses Jekyll, it is from a quick build using [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) by Barry Clark. 

I found it on the Internet, and it was good.
